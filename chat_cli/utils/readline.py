    When coloured ANSI escape sequences are included in the prompt string that
    is passed to `input()`, GNU Readline (used by Python for interactive input
    if available) counts those bytes as **printable** characters unless
    instructed otherwise. This results in mis-aligned cursor positioning and
    broken line wrapping once the user types beyond the terminal width.
    
    Readline solves this by allowing non-printing parts to be wrapped between
    the control characters \001 (start of *hidden* sequence) and \002 (end).
